You can target specific products, categories, or even mix and match different product types—for example, “Buy 2 Shirts, Get 1 Tie Free” or “Buy 3 Candles, Get 2 Holders at 50% Off.” Ideal for seasonal campaigns, flash sales, or evergreen offers, BXGX deals are designed to work automatically—no coupon codes, no manual setup for the customer. The intuitive interface allows store owners of any technical level to create and manage these deals in just a few clicks.
